# Tobacco lab test

Before the introduction of the application, users use the excel app to perform the tobacco testing (22 different kinds of tests).

The aim of the application is to solve:

1. Scalability - Excel has limitations in handling large datasets. A database-backed application can handle much larger volumes of data and more complex operations.
2. Data Integrity: Excel files can be prone to errors, especially when multiple users are updating them concurrently. A database-backed application can enforce data integrity rules, reducing the risk of errors.
3. Security: Excel files are typically stored on local machines or shared drives, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access. A database-backed application can implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data.
4. Collaboration: Collaborating on Excel files can be challenging, especially when multiple users need to update the same file. A database-backed application can provide features for concurrent access and collaboration.
5. Performance: Excel can become slow when dealing with large datasets or complex calculations. A database-backed application can be optimized for performance, providing faster response times.
6. Reporting and Analysis: While Excel offers basic reporting and analysis capabilities, a database-backed application can provide more advanced reporting and analysis features, such as dashboards and data visualizations.
7. Integration: Integrating Excel with other systems can be difficult. A database-backed application can be easily integrated with other systems using APIs or other integration methods.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.x.x.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
